# 4900-Project
This is a basic level sample login system done for my 4900 Project
After downloading the code type "npm i" into the terminal to get all the necessary dependencies 
to start server type "npm run serverStart" into the terminal
I hid my mongodb connection in my own .env file so you would have to use your own mongo account for a db connection however once connected everything should function properly
This program allows a user to create an account and login at will if an account is already created
once logged in the user is allowed to upload files into the server at will
the end goal of it is to create a functional login and file upload system that can fetch and send data upon user's request
